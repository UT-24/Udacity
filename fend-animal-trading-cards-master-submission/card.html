			<p id="description">Clouded leopards are one of the oldest known species of big cat. They are so called because of the cloud like spots on their body.  
			They are native to Asia and are one of two big cats belonging to the genus Neofelis. They have short limbs with wide paws and spend a majority of their time on trees.  Long tails and hind paws that rotate backward enable them to climb down trees head first!</p>
